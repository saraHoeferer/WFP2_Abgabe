    - 'Oh, hello stranger!

      My name is Stan.

      I think...'
    - You see, I've been in here for ages, and my mind starts to play hide and seek.
    - 'I can''t find my coins or my precious axe...

      All gone..'

      anyone these days!"
    - Oh well, I am not trying to scare you.
    - Perhaps a young clever one like you could help an old soul organize this chaos?
    - 'I have written it all down here on the list!

      Take a look behind the
      door.
